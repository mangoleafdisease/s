After three years, the Bureau of Private School requested a new school building and ground. The school's board of directors was organized, with Engr. Fidel C. Dagani Sr. as President and Director. In 1972, Ceferino L. Baltazar Sr. took over as Director, and Dr. Eladio Pro Anino was elevated to the Directorship..In 1972, a conflagration destroyed the school, but a three-story complex of forty-eight rooms was built through joint efforts of the Atega sisters, Mrs. Basilisa Atega Kittilstedvt and the late Mrs. Prosperidad Atega Rodriguez. The school was razed in 2001, and the old SEC registrations had not been renewed. After the death of Dr. Eladio Pro Anino, NORMI held elections for the new Board of Directors, with Engr. Manuel A. Rodriguez elected as chairman and President. In 2003, the SEC registration was approved under the name New Northern Mindanao Colleges. The BOD of New NORMI authorized Mr. George C. Cabrera to continue as President or Chief Executive Officer until the old NORMI was merged into New NORMI."}]}
